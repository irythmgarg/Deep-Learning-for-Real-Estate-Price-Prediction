Real Estate Price Prediction Using Deep Learning: Theory and Approach
Real estate price prediction is a common regression problem where the goal is to predict property prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and more. Deep learning provides an advanced framework for such predictions, utilizing neural networks to model complex patterns and relationships in the data.

1. Problem Statement
Predict the price of a real estate property based on its attributes:

Input: Features like location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
Output: Predicted price of the property.
2. Dataset
The dataset typically contains rows representing properties and columns for features and the target price. Key columns might include:

Numerical features: Area (in square feet), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, property age, etc.
Categorical features: Location, type of property (apartment, villa), etc.
Target variable: Price of the property.
3. Challenges
Non-linear relationships: Real estate prices often depend on non-linear interactions between features.
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Overfitting: Deep learning models might overfit, especially on small datasets.
4. Neural Network Architecture
A feedforward neural network (FNN) is typically used for regression problems like real estate price prediction.

Model Architecture
Input Layer:
Receives preprocessed features.
Hidden Layers:
Multiple dense (fully connected) layers with activation functions like ReLU to capture complex patterns.
Output Layer:
A single neuron with a linear activation function to predict the price (a continuous value).
Loss Function:
Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used for regression problems.
Optimization:
Optimizer like Adam for efficient learning.
5. Workflow
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
Encode categorical features (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Normalize numerical features to bring them to a similar scale.
Step 2: Splitting Data
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70%-15%-15%).
Step 3: Building the Model
python
